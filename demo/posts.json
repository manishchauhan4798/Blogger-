    "content": "Organizations are finding it equally challenging to find skilled data scientists as they are having difficulty understanding which information sources provide the best input for artificial intelligence-driven analysis.\n\nThis environment has created a conundrum for artificial intelligence and machine learning vendors. Experts forecast that the data scientist shortage will increase by nearly 30-percent by the year 2020. While colleges and universities are working to close the gap, the need for these talented professionals is outpacing the demand for skilled talent.\n\nAdditionally, the role of the data scientist has yet to be clearly defined. This is due, in part, because data scientistsâ€™ roles are as unique as the organizations that employ their services.",
